      <p>
        As the growing number of coronavirus cases continues to strain limited hospital resources,
        <strong>college campuses with largely vacated dormitories are in a unique position to
          provide additional beds and facilities to hospitals</strong>.

        Dorms can be repurposed as alternative hospital sites to house recovering patients
        and offer temporary lodging to medical personnel, coordinated through health care providers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the MGGG Redistricting Lab, we usually study gerrymandering.  But with the same geodata
        and math modeling skills, we can build a simple model that connects
        <span class="redtext">hospitals</span> to nearby
        <span class="bluetext">college campuses</span>.
      </p>

          <h3>What are you seeing in these maps?</h3>
          <p>
            Our model flows people from hospitals to universities in a way that respects
            bed capacity and minimizes travel time.  Here are the separate populations
            that will be transferred from hospitals to colleges:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Hospital patients with non-COVID conditions</li>
            <li>Hospital patients recovering from COVID</li>
            <li>Medical personnel who need a place to sleep without exposing their families and home communities to risk</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By freeing beds, this alliance allows hospitals to convert more beds to critical
            care and provides support for front-line medical workers and other first responders.
          </p>

          <h3>Model assumptions and data sources</h3>
          <p>
            This is a <b>mathematical model and mapping tool</b> intended to lend quantitative support to the qualitative
            point that available dorm capacity is large enough to have a significant impact
            as the nation mobilizes infrastructure for COVID-19 treatment. (See <b>Nation at a Glance</b> below
            for a visualization showing all 50 states.)
            For now, our model only includes flows of non-COVID patients and medical personnel.
            We are working to sync up with a University of Washington model of projected COVID demand on hospitals
            and will add recovering COVID patients at that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Department of Homeland Security provides national shapefiles of 
            <a href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/colleges-and-universities" target="blank">universities</a> and 
            <a href="https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6ac5e325468c4cb9b905f1728d6fbf0f_0" target="blank">hospitals</a>.
            Share of dorm capacity that is available for hospital use is left as a parameter in the model, 
            considering that the three types of populations will have to be housed separately and in suitable facilities.
            The mathematical formulation is 
            described <a href="https://mggg.org/uploads/COVID-LP.pdf" target="blank">here</a>.
            See <a href="https://github.com/mggg/covid-analysis" target="blank">our GitHub repo</a> for full details of 
            model structure and parameters.
          </p>
          
          <h3>How to use this model</h3>
          <p>
          We anticipate several uses for this model in keeping with its design. 
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Planners can look at the campuses in order of utilization (sort by last column in the Data Table) to glean a 
                priority order for reaching out to university presidents to mobilize the campus response.
              <li> Planners can look at regions of the state with long travel times to decide where other building types or new 
                emergency facilities will best complement the campus response.
              <li> Universities can set the 
                mapping tool to reflect their own available dorm capacity, then receive an indication of which hospitals they are best suited to support. 
            </ul>
          <p>
          Because the precise model output depends so critically on the quality of input data and assumptions, which are 
            necessarily very rough in this case, these uses
          are better supported than planning around detailed assignment numbers of patients and medical staff.
