      <p>
        As the growing number of coronavirus cases continues to strain limited hospital resources,
        <strong>college campuses with largely vacated dormitories are in a unique position to
          provide additional beds and facilities to hospitals</strong>.

        Dorms can be repurposed as alternative sites to house recovering patients
        and offer temporary lodging to medical personnel, coordinated through hospital systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the MGGG Redistricting Lab, we usually study gerrymandering.  But with the same geodata
        and math modeling skills, we can build a simple model that connects
        <span class="redtext">hospitals</span> to nearby
        <span class="bluetext">college campuses</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s take a look at <span id="state_name_here">Massachusetts</span>.

          <h3>What are you seeing in these maps?</h3>
          <p>
            This is a <b>mathematical model and mapping tool</b> intended to lend quantitative support to a qualitative
            point:  available dorm capacity can have a significant impact
            as the nation mobilizes infrastructure for COVID-19 treatment. (See <b><a href="#at-a-glance">Nation at a Glance</a></b> below
            for a visualization showing all 50 states.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Our model flows people from hospitals to universities in a way that accounts for
            bed capacity and minimizes travel time.  Here are the separate populations
            that can be transferred from hospitals to colleges:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Medical personnel who need a place to sleep without exposing their families and home communities to risk</li>
            <li>Hospital patients with non-COVID conditions</li>
            <li>Hospital patients recovering from COVID</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By freeing beds, this alliance allows hospitals to convert more beds to critical
            care and provides support for front-line medical workers and other first responders.
          </p>


          
          <h3>How to use this model</h3>
          <p>
          We anticipate several uses for this model in keeping with its design. 
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Priority campuses.</b> You can sort the campuses in order of utilization (last column 
                in the Data Table) to glean a priority order for mobilizing the campus response.
              <li> <b>Underserved areas.</b> Planners can look at regions of the state with long travel times to decide where other building types or new 
                emergency facilities will best complement the campus response.
              <li> <b>Well-matched hospitals.</b> Universities can set the 
                mapping tool to reflect their own available dorm capacity, then receive an indication of which hospitals 
                they are best suited to support. 
            </ul>
          <p>
          Precise model output depends critically on the quality of input data and assumptions, and the need for speed 
          and generality makes those very approximate in this case.  Therefore the applications identified above are better 
          supported by the model than relying on detailed assignment numbers of patients and medical staff.

          <h3>Model assumptions and data sources</h3>
          <p>
            The current model only includes flows of medical personnel and non-COVID patients.  This is <b>not</b> a 
            predictive model.  
            We are working to sync up with other models of projected COVID demand on hospitals
            and will add recovering COVID patients at that time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Share of dorm capacity that is available for hospital use is left as a parameter in the model, 
            considering that the three types of populations will have to be housed separately and in suitable facilities.
            The mathematical formulation is 
            described <a href="https://mggg.org/uploads/COVID-LP.pdf" target="blank">here</a>, and data sourcing is
